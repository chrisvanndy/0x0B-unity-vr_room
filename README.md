## ABOUT THE APPLICATION
Mars Escape Room is a seated Virtual Reality experience designed in Unity Game Engine for Oculus Quest 2.  The Application utilizes the AR Foundations Toolkit and XR Interactions Toolkit to provide users with a smooth and immersive experience.  

## THE EXPERIENCE
Users find themselves in the midst of a crisis! The Mars Station's oxygen has been taken out by seismic activity. Only a few minutes of oxygen remain in the pod. A simple puzzle is set in place for users solve, replacing the breakers that have caused the oxygen to go out.

When complete, access to the main chamber is granted. One last tast remains; turn the oxygen back on.
